# Text-Classfication-using-CNN4

This repo is for text classification project built using CNN model to classify different documents in 20 classes. The CNN model was built using Keras (Tensorflow) and pretrained Glove embeddings were leveraged to obtain word embeddings. The custom model created was able to achieve about 80% of accuracy.
